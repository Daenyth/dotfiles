#
# Calcurse keys configuration file
#
# This file sets the keybindings used by Calcurse.
# Lines beginning with "#" are comments, and ignored by Calcurse.
# To assign a keybinding to an action, this file must contain a line
# with the following syntax:
#
#        ACTION  KEY1  KEY2  ...  KEYn
#
# Where ACTION is what will be performed when KEY1, KEY2, ..., or KEYn
# will be pressed.
#
# To define bindings which use the CONTROL key, prefix the key with 'C-'.
# The escape, space bar and horizontal Tab key can be specified using
# the 'ESC', 'SPC' and 'TAB' keyword, respectively.
# Arrow keys can also be specified with the UP, DWN, LFT, RGT keywords.
# Last, Home and End keys can be assigned using 'KEY_HOME' and 'KEY_END'
# keywords.
#
# A description of what each ACTION keyword is used for is available
# from calcurse online configuration menu.
